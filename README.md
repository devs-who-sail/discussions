# Welcome to the Devs Who Sail community!

Devs Who Sail is a community for software developers that love sailing.

Some of us write software for sailing, and some of us sail to get away from computers. Some of us work from boats, and others are working to get a boat. Some know a lot about software and are getting our sea legs. Others are old salts that are learning to code.

We all love software and sailing and are interested in exploring them together.
